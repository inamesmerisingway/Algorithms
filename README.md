# Algorithms

Requirement based self deviced Algorithms.

## SidSurfer

Algorithm which takes in an array and number of batches and partitions it in such a way that the maximum sum of each batch's weight remains minimum possible.

## Dynamic Concurrency Based Batch Partitioning

Algorithm to generate batches of incoming Data Array in concurrency based length so that the further control can pick "N" (N : number of concurrency) batches and request the endpoint without needing to worry about equal partitioning and max use of available concurrency on an endpoint.
